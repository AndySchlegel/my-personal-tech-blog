## #1 - Security Scanning from Day 1

**Date:** 2026-02-20
**Phase:** Project Setup

**Context:**
In one of my earlier projects, security scanning (tfsec, Checkov, Trufflehog) was added late in development. This meant potential issues accumulated before being caught.

**Decision:**
Set up all security tools before writing the first line of application code: GitHub Actions security workflows, ESLint, Prettier, and Husky pre-commit hooks.

**Takeaway:**
Security is not a feature you add later - it's a foundation you build on. Adding it from day 1 costs almost nothing. Adding it later means fixing accumulated issues.

## #2 - Keep Documentation Lean

**Date:** 2026-02-20
**Phase:** Project Setup

**Context:**
In a previous project, documentation grew to 8+ separate files. Files became outdated quickly and started contradicting each other because too many places needed updating.

**Decision:**
Only 3 documentation files, each with a clear purpose:
- `README.md` - What is this project (for visitors)
- `ACTION_PLAN.md` - Current progress and next steps (updated every session)
- `LESSONS_LEARNED.md` - What I learned (this file, append-only)

**Takeaway:**
More docs does not mean better docs. Three well-maintained files beat ten stale ones.
